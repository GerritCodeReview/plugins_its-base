      "message": "This does not solve the problem.\nI noticed that the function isEnabled() is sometimes called with a refname, and sometimes with a branchname.\nSo, this may fix one case, but it breaks another...\n\n\nLook in \"public boolean isEnabled(ChangeEvent event)\", in most cases the branchname is used, but in RefUpdatedEvent the refname is used. Also in the onCommitReceived() handler in validation/ItsValidateComment.java the refname is used.\n\n\nSo, I think the best solution is to prefix the branchname with \u0027refs/heads/\u0027 in case it is not there yet.",
